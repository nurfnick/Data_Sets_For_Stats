# Data_Sets_For_Stats
A collection of data sets that could be useful for Intro to Prob and Stats.

In this github repository you will find 

1. Some excellent datasets that I have hand picked to work for the project
2. An example that I put together looking at hockey and the 2019 NHL season
3. Some files in R for the more programming savy students.  If you are a computer science or mathematics student, I encourage you to consider doing your project in R
