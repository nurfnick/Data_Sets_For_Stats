```{r setup, include=FALSE}

```

## Oklahoma PPP

Since the data was released to the public I was interested in doing an analysis or atleast getting a project started so that someone else could finish it later!

The data loaded above was gathered from the website the Small Business Administration's website https://www.sba.gov/funding-programs/loans/coronavirus-relief-options/paycheck-protection-program?utm_medium=email&utm_source=govdelivery#section-header-11 on 7/7/2020.  Only data from Oklahoma will be exmained in this report.  The excel file was cleaned to only include this data and uploaded to github for ease of access.


## Find Your Data:  Project Part 1
Here is a sample of the data:

```{r}
df[0:10,] #displays first 10 rows and all columns
```

There is a lot of data here.  Unfortunately it does not currently meet the requirements of the project because there is only one true quantitative variable, JobsRetained.  I am going to create a few columns trying to estimate the amount of money each loan was for by using the LoanRange column.


### Data Cleaning




```{r uniques}
ranges <- unique(df['LoanRange'])

ranges

```
There are only five ranges present in the data.  I'll gather the smallest and lowest value for each loan and put it in our dataset as a column.

```{r}
df['MinLoan']<-case_when(df$LoanRange=='a $5-10 million'~5000000,
          df$LoanRange=='b $2-5 million'~2000000,
          df$LoanRange=='c $1-2 million'~1000000,
          df$LoanRange=='d $350,000-1 million'~350000,
          df$LoanRange=='e $150,000-350,000'~150000)


df['MaxLoan']<-case_when(df$LoanRange=='a $5-10 million'~10000000,
          df$LoanRange=='b $2-5 million'~5000000,
          df$LoanRange=='c $1-2 million'~2000000,
          df$LoanRange=='d $350,000-1 million'~1000000,
          df$LoanRange=='e $150,000-350,000'~350000)

```

I am just curious how much money came into the state.  At a minimum

```{r}
sum(df$MinLoan)
```
2.5 billion dollars, not too shabby!  That is the minimum, the max is 
```{r}
sum(df$MaxLoan)
```
closer to 6 billion dollars.  We don't know the exact amount, but we know it is inbetween those dollar amounts!

### Data Description

So now my data set meets the minimum requirements for the project.  Let's see if we can analyze the varaibles. 
```{r}
summary(df)
```
So this output is very intense!  It went through every variable (and the case descriptors) and did some basic analysis of each.  


For your paper you should carefully describe any variable you think you might use.  For me that would include CD, this is the Congressional District.  Ada is in the fourth congressional district, seen here:

![OK-04 Congressional District](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8a/Oklahoma_US_Congressional_District_4_%28since_2013%29.tif/lossless-page1-1920px-Oklahoma_US_Congressional_District_4_%28since_2013%29.tif.png)

They often talk about congress 'bringing home the bacon', let's separate out our district so we can analyze it later

```{r}
cd4 <- df[which(df$CD=='OK - 04'),]
summary(cd4)
```
So at a minimum:
```{r}
sum(cd4$MinLoan)
```
325 million!
