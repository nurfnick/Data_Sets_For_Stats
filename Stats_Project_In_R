## The 2018-2019 Hockey Season

This was an exciting hockey season for me. My team home town team, St. Louis Blues, won Lord Stanley's Cup.  I wanted to examine the season and use the R programming language.

```{r}
#summary(df)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
#hist(df["GP"])
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
